 Thesis title: How do climate-driven shifts in phytoplankton composition influence carbon and nitrogen uptake and recycling along the west Antarctic Peninsula?
  Supervised by: Dr Sian Henley (Edinburgh), Dr Alex Poulton (Lyell Centre), Prof Keith Davidson (Scottish Association for Marine Science), Prof Mike Meredith (British Antarctic Survey). My PhD project aims to better understand the climate driven processes influencing phytoplankton community composition and biogeochemistry (C & N cycling) along the west Antarctic Peninsula by creating a data time series over the austral summer. This project is based around conducting an Antarctic field season in 2021/22, performing phytoplankton species identification alongside C & N uptake experiments. My PhD project is part of and funded by the E4 DTP (NERC)

  description = """Thesis title: The role of iron bound carbon for organic matter preservation and global climate systems: an experimental approach. Supervised by Dr Christian MÃ¤rz, Prof Caroline Peacock, Dr Johan Faust and Dr Oliver Moore. In this project I investigated the role of carboxyl groups in a preservative sorption mechanism of organic carbon to reactive iron phases in marine sediments. This involved using an experimental approach to synthesise organic-ferrihydrite compounds and applying a chemical extraction to these in order to better understand the specificity of this extraction technique for quantifying iron bound carbon. From this study we were able to quantify uncertainties in techniques used to quantify preserved organic carbon on a global scale and suggest improvements to reduce these uncertainties. This project was supported by grants awards to Changing Arctic Ocean ChAOS, NERC and MinORG, ERC."""
