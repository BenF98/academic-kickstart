title: Implications of organic ligand dependent preservation of iron in the
  seafloor for marine carbon cycling- QRA ADM 2020
abstract: >-
  The biological carbon pump represents a key feedback cycle in the Earth’s
  climate system. Organic

  carbon (OC) export to the seafloor by marine phytoplankton in the upper ocean accounts for ~0.2–0.4

  Pg per annum, representing a significant sink for atmospheric carbon. Coupling of OC and Fe is known

  to create a “rusty sink” for metastable carbon preservation in the seafloor, a process comparable to

  the protection of terrestrially derived organic matter promoted by iron in soils. With ice sheet extent

  representing a control on the export of both OC and Fe to the seafloor, the glacial-interglacial cycles

  of the Quaternary are likely to have created significant alterations in the OC and Fe fluxes; and thereby

  in the preservation of sedimentary OC. Despite the potential importance of the Fe-OC coupling in the

  Quaternary carbon cycle, there is limited knowledge about the nature of the Fe-OC coupling, and

  methods to quantify the amount of carbon trapped in the “rusty sink” are poorly constrained and

  uncalibrated.


  In this study, we explore how the structure of a common carbon compound associated with iron

  minerals affects their organomineral stability as an indicator of their ability to preserve carbon within

  the seafloor. Organic carbon-free marine sediments were spiked with known amounts of synthesized

  Fe-OC co-precipitates designed to represent natural compounds covering a range of Fe to OC affinities

  (i.e., ferrihydrite co-precipitated with carboxylic acids, replicating the end product of degraded amino

  acids). These were subject to standard extraction procedures for the iron mineral phases and

  associated OC, and measured for Fe and OC extraction efficiency. We find that the extractability, and

  thus the stability, of iron organominerals is dependent upon the structure and quantity of organic

  carbon associated with iron. Specifically, those organominerals containing a greater concentration of

  carbon appear to suffer from greater structural disorder, and thus less stability. This leaves the OC

  associated with these phases more vulnerable to microbial degradation and therefore liberation of OC

  from the seafloor as CO2. Crucially this shows that iron organominerals cannot be considered a ‘bulk

  phase’ and behave differently dependent upon the specific structure of organic molecules associated

  with the iron mineral. This represents a potentially significant ‘tipping point’ in carbon storage in the

  seafloor, whereby iron minerals associated with a high weight % of OC are likely to retain OC for a

  shorter period of time compared to low % OC organominerals.
