I am a marine biogeochemist interested in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and metals in the water column and marine sediments. My research is interdisciplinary and utilises a large number of techniques, most commonly chemical extractions isotopic and trace metal analyses alongside biological methods for phytoplankton species identification. 

Much of my work is conducted in the context of climate change, and has involved work on samples from both poles representing areas undergoing rapid climate and chemical change. My wider interests include geophysical influences on marine chemistry at the land-ocean interface and the detection of organic compounds as signatures of past life on other planets.
